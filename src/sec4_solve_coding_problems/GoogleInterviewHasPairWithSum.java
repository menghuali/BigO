 * Sample 2: given the arry [4, 2, 1, 3] and the given number is 8. The function

     * 7. Walk through your approach, comment things and see where you may be able

     * work? Did you use all the information the interviewer gave you? Bottleneck is
     * the part of the code with the biggest Big O. Focus on that. Sometimes this
     * occurs with repeated work as well.
     * 
     * I can improve the function in this way...
     * I still need a loop to go through the array. For the current item array[i], I
     * know if the previous array items has a number equals to expected - array[i],
     * then the pair is found. I can put the iterated number in a hash set, adding
     * an item to a hash set will be O(1). If the hash set=, aka iterated items
     * doesn't have the number that array[i] needed, add array[i] to the hash set
     * and iterate the next item in the array util found pair or each the end of the
     * array.
     * 
     * Example 1:
     * i = 0; array = {4, 3, 1, 2, 5}; current = 4; need = 4; hash set = {}; pair
     * not found yet, contiue
     * i = 1; array = {3, 1, 2, 5}; current = 3; need = 5; hash set = {4}; pair not
     * found yet, contiue
     * i = 2; array = {1, 2, 5}; current = 1; need = 7; hash set = {4, 3}; pair not
     * found yet, contiue
     * i = 3; array = {2, 5}; current = 2; need = 6; hash set = {4, 3, 1}; pair not
     * found yet, contiue
     * i = 4; array = {5}; current = 5; need = 3; hash set = {4, 3, 1, 2}; pair
     * found, return true
     * 
     * Example 1:
     * i = 0; array = {4, 3, 1, 2}; current = 4; need = 4; hash set = {}; pair not
     * found yet, contiue
     * i = 1; array = {3, 1, 2}; current = 3; need = 5; hash set = {4}; pair not
     * found yet, contiue
     * i = 2; array = {1, 2}; current = 1; need = 7; hash set = {4, 3}; pair not
     * found yet, contiue
     * i = 3; array = {2}; current = 2; need = 6; hash set = {4, 3, 1}; pair not
     * found yet, contiue
     * i = 4: reach the end of array, return false.
     * 
     * Add and look up item in a hash set is O(1). Since there is one loop, so the
     * worst case is O(n).
     * 
     * 9. Modularize your code from the very beginning. Break up your code into
     * beautiful small pieces and add just comments if you need to.
     * 
     * 10. Start actually writing your code now.
     * 
     * 11. Think about error checks and how you can break this code.
     * What if the array is empty or null;
