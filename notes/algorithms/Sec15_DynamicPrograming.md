## What is Dynamic Programming (DP)?
[GeeksForGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dynamic-programming/#what-is-dynamic-programming-dp):
> **Dynamic Programming** is a method used in mathematics and computer science to <u>solve complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems. By solving each subproblem only once and storing the results, it avoids redundant computations, leading to more efficient solutions for a wide range of problems.</u>

## How does DP work?

[GeeksForGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dynamic-programming/#how-does-dynamic-programming-dp-work)
> * Identify Subproblems: Divide the main problem into smaller, independent subproblems.
> * Store Solutions: Solve each subproblem and store the solution in a table or array.
> * Build Up Solutions: Use the stored solutions to build up the solution to the main problem.
> * Avoid Redundancy: By storing solutions, DP ensures that each subproblem is solved only once, reducing computation time.

<br>**Other explaination**<br>
> * Can your problem be divided into subproblems?
> * Can you appply recursive solutions on the subproblems?
> * Are there repetitive subproblems?
> * Memorize subproblem solutions.
